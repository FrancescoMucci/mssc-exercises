# Exercises for the course *Modelli di Sistemi Sequenziali e Concorrenti*.

In the course *Modelli di Sistemi Sequenziali e Concorrenti* we covered operational and denotational semantics of sequential programming languages (functional and imperative) and studied formal methods (process algebras) to specify, design, implement, analyze and demonstrate properties of concurrent and distributed systems.

This repository contains solutions to some exercises found in the handouts provided by the course instructor (dated November 3, 2016); in particular, the following exercises were performed: 
- Mathematical preliminaries: es. 2.7, 2.14, 3.16, 4.6;
- Sequential systems: es. 5.5, 6.6, 6.16, 7.6, 8.5, 9.9;
- Concurrent systems: es. 11.8.

This work was done during the [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://www.informaticamagistrale.unifi.it/) at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/) as part of the exam *B012489 - Modelli di Sistemi Sequenziali e Concorrenti (Models of Sequential and Concurrent Systems)*.
